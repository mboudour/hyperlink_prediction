    "## 1. Introduction to Hypergraphs \n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional graph theory has been instrumental in modeling pairwise relationships between entities across numerous domains. However, many real-world systems exhibit complex multi-way interactions that cannot be adequately captured by simple pairwise connections. Hypergraphs provide a natural mathematical framework for representing these higher-order relationships, where a single hyperedge can connect any number of vertices simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of hypergraphs was first introduced by Claude Berge in the 1970s as a generalization of ordinary graphs [Berge (1973)](https://archive.org/details/graphshypergraph0000berg). While a traditional graph consists of vertices connected by edges that link exactly two vertices, a hypergraph allows edges (called hyperedges) to connect any subset of vertices. This fundamental difference enables hypergraphs to model scenarios such as group collaborations, multi-participant interactions, and complex dependencies that are ubiquitous in biological, social, and technological systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider, for example, a research collaboration network where traditional graphs might only capture pairwise co-authorships between researchers. A hypergraph representation, however, can directly model the actual collaborative structure by having each hyperedge represent a research paper with all its co-authors as connected vertices. This provides a more accurate and informative representation of the underlying collaborative dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of hypergraph theory has grown significantly in recent years due to its applications in machine learning, network analysis, and data mining. Hyperlink prediction, in particular, has emerged as a crucial problem in understanding and predicting the evolution of complex networks. Unlike traditional link prediction that focuses on predicting pairwise connections, hyperlink prediction aims to predict the formation of new hyperedges or the addition of new vertices to existing hyperedges.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook aims to provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding hypergraphs while maintaining accessibility for practitioners and researchers new to the field. We will explore the formal definitions, key properties, and practical algorithms that form the backbone of modern hypergraph analysis and hyperlink prediction methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For an overview of the fundamental concepts and methods in hypergraph analysis, see the GitHub page [Boudourides (2025)](https://github.com/mboudour/var/tree/master/Key%20Methods%20of%20Hypergraph%20Analysis%20Seminars)."

    "## 2. Fundamental Definitions and Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Basic Hypergraph Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypergraph provides a mathematical framework for representing complex multi-way relationships that extend beyond the pairwise connections of traditional graphs. The formal definition establishes the foundational structure upon which all subsequent analysis is built.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.1 (Hypergraph):** A hypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V, E)$ consists of:\n",
    "- A finite set $V = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_n\\}$ of vertices (also called nodes)\n",
    "- A family $E = \\{e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_m\\}$ of hyperedges, where each hyperedge $e_i \\subseteq V$ is a non-empty subset of vertices\n",
    "\n",
    "The key distinction from ordinary graphs lies in the fact that each hyperedge $e_i$ can contain any number of vertices, formally expressed as $|e_i| \\geq 1$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, m\\}$. When $|e_i| = 2$ for all hyperedges, the hypergraph reduces to an ordinary graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.2 (Incidence):** A vertex $v \\in V$ is said to be **incident** to a hyperedge $e \\in E$ if and only if $v \\in e$. Similarly, a hyperedge $e$ is incident to all vertices contained within it. Moreover, two vertices $u$ and $v$ are said to be **adjacent** if and only if there exists a hyperedge $e_i$ that contains both vertices $u$ and $v$. The **neighbors** of a vertex $v$ are all nodes $u$ which are adjacent to $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.3 (Degree of Vertex):** The degree of a vertex $v \\in V$, denoted $d(v)$, is the number of hyperedges that contain $v$:\n",
    "$$d(v) = |\\{e \\in E : v \\in e\\}|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.4 (Degree or Size of Hyperedge):** The degree or size (or cardinality) of a hyperedge $e \\in E$, denoted $\\delta(e)$, is the number of vertices it contains, i.e., $\\delta(e) = |e|$. A hyperedge of size $k$ is called a $k$-uniform hyperedge.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Special Classes of Hypergraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Several important subclasses of hypergraphs arise frequently in theoretical analysis and practical applications, each with distinct structural properties that influence algorithmic approaches and analytical techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.5 (k-Uniform Hypergraph):** A hypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V, E)$ is called $k$-uniform if every hyperedge has exactly $k$ vertices, i.e., $|e| = k$ for all $e \\in E$. When $k = 2$, the hypergraph is equivalent to an ordinary graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.6 (Simple Hypergraph):** A hypergraph is simple if it contains no repeated hyperedges and no hyperedge is a proper subset of another hyperedge. Formally, for any $e_i, e_j \\in E$ with $i \\neq j$, we have $e_i \\neq e_j$ and $e_i \\not\\subset e_j$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.7 (Regular Hypergraph):** A hypergraph is $r$-regular if every vertex has the same degree $r$, i.e., $d(v) = r$ for all $v \\in V$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Hypergraph Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical representation of hypergraphs can take several forms, each offering different computational advantages and theoretical insights. Understanding these representations is crucial for implementing algorithms and analyzing hypergraph properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Set-Based Representation:**\n",
    "Following the user's preferred representation, a hypergraph can be represented as a dictionary where keys correspond to hyperedge identifiers and values are sets of vertices:\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{H} = \\{e_1: \\{v_{i_1}, v_{i_2}, \\ldots\\}, e_2: \\{v_{j_1}, v_{j_2}, \\ldots\\}, \\ldots\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation is particularly intuitive and computationally efficient for many algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incidence Matrix Representation:**\n",
    "The incidence matrix $H \\in \\{0,1\\}^{n \\times m}$ of a hypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V, E)$ with $n$ vertices and $m$ hyperedges is defined as:\n",
    "$$H_{ij} = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "1 & \\text{if } v_i \\in e_j \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This representation explicitly captures the incidence relationships between vertices and hyperedges, making it particularly useful for linear algebraic operations and spectral analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Spectral Properties of Hypergraphs\n",
    "\n",
    "Spectral analysis of hypergraphs extends the powerful techniques of graph spectral theory to higher-order structures, providing deep insights into hypergraph properties and enabling sophisticated algorithmic approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.8 (Hypergraph Laplacian):** For a hypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V, E)$ with incidence matrix $H$, we can define several Laplacian operators. The most common is the normalized hypergraph Laplacian:\n",
    "$$L = I - D_v^{-1/2} H W D_e^{-1} H^T D_v^{-1/2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "- $D_v$ is the diagonal degree matrix of vertices: $(D_v)_{ii} = d(v_i)$\n",
    "- $D_e$ is the diagonal degree matrix of hyperedges: $(D_e)_{jj} = |e_j|$\n",
    "- $W$ is a diagonal weight matrix for hyperedges (often $W = I$ for unweighted hypergraphs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Hypergraph Connectivity and Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding connectivity in hypergraphs requires careful consideration of how vertices can be connected through sequences of hyperedges, leading to several distinct notions of paths and connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.9 (Hypergraph Path):** A path in a hypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V, E)$ from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ is a sequence of vertices $u = v_0, v_1, \\ldots, v_k = v$ and hyperedges $e_1, e_2, \\ldots, e_k$ such that $\\{v_{i-1}, v_i\\} \\subseteq e_i$ for all $i \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, k\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.10 (Adjacent Connectivity):** Two vertices $u, v \\in V$ are (adjacently) connected if they are adjacent, i.e., if there exists a hyperedge $e \\in E$ such that $\\{u, v\\} \\subseteq e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.11 (Path Connectivity):** Two vertices $u, v \\in V$ are path-connected if there exists a path from $u$ to $v$ in the hypergraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.12 (Connected Components):** A connected component of a hypergraph is a maximal set of vertices that are pairwise path-connected. The hypergraph is connected if it has exactly one connected component.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 2.13 (Hypergraph Distance):** The distance $d(u, v)$ between vertices $u$ and $v$ is the minimum number of hyperedges in any path from $u$ to $v$. If no such path exists, $d(u, v) = \\infty$.\n",
    "\n",
    "These connectivity concepts are fundamental for understanding information flow, clustering, and community structure in hypergraphs, and they play crucial roles in hyperlink prediction algorithms."

    "## 3. Hyperlink Prediction Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Problem Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we are going to discuss hyperlink prediction in the context of three distinct but related computational problems that address different aspects of hypergraph structure recovery and forecasting. Each formulation presents unique theoretical challenges and practical applications, requiring specialized approaches and evaluation methodologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3.1 (Hypergraph Reconstruction):** Given a hypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V, E)$, the hypergraph reconstruction problem seeks to learn the underlying structural patterns and generate new hyperedges that are consistent with the observed hypergraph structure. Formally, given a hypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V, E)$, the goal is to learn a generative model that can produce a set of predicted hyperedges $\\hat{E}$ such that the predicted hyperedges exhibit similar structural properties to the original hypergraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reconstruction problem can be often (among other ways) formulated as learning a scoring function $s: 2^V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ that assigns high scores to hyperedge configurations that are likely to exist based on the observed structural patterns:\n",
    "$$s(e^*) = f(\\text{structural_features}(e^*, \\mathcal{H}))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $f$ is learned from the hypergraph structure and $\\text{structural_features}$ captures relevant topological properties. The quality of reconstruction is evaluated by generating new hyperedges using the learned model and measuring how well these predictions match the original hypergraph structure through metrics such as precision, recall, and structural similarity measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3.2 (Hypergraph Prediction with Hidden Hyperedges):** In this setting, we are given a hypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V, E)$ from which a subset of hyperedges $E_{hidden} \\subset E$ is deliberately hidden, resulting in an observed hypergraph $\\mathcal{H}_{visible} = (V, E \\setminus E_{hidden})$. The objective is to predict the hidden hyperedges based on the visible structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, we seek to learn a scoring function $s: 2^V \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ such that:\n",
    "$$s(e) > s(e') \\text{ for } e \\in E_{hidden} \\text{ and } e' \\notin E$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The prediction accuracy is typically evaluated by ranking potential hyperedges according to their scores and measuring how well the hidden hyperedges are recovered. This formulation enables controlled evaluation of hyperlink prediction algorithms and provides insights into the predictability of hypergraph structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the hidden hyperedge prediction evaluation is enhanced through Jaccard similarity analysis, which provides a more nuanced assessment than exact matching. Instead of requiring perfect hyperedge reconstruction, the Jaccard similarity $J(A,B) = \\frac{|A \\cap B|}{|A \\cup B|}$ measures the overlap between predicted and hidden hyperedges. This approach uses a threshold (typically 0.3) to classify predictions as positive when $J(\\text{predicted}, \\text{hidden}) > 0.3$, enabling the computation of more realistic ML scores that account for partial matches and structural similarity rather than demanding exact reconstruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3.3 (Temporal Hypergraph Prediction):** Given a temporal sequence of hypergraphs $\\{\\mathcal{H}_1, \\mathcal{H}_2, \\ldots, \\mathcal{H}_T\\}$ where $\\mathcal{H}_t = (V_t, E_t)$ represents the hypergraph state at time $t$, the temporal prediction problem involves predicting future hyperedges $E_{T+1}, E_{T+2}, \\ldots$ based on the historical evolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The temporal formulation can be expressed as:\n",
    "$$P(E_{T+k} | \\mathcal{H}_1, \\mathcal{H}_2, \\ldots, \\mathcal{H}_T) \\text{ for } k \\geq 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires modeling the temporal dynamics of hypergraph evolution, including patterns of hyperedge formation, growth, and potentially dissolution. The temporal aspect introduces additional complexity as the prediction must account for both structural dependencies and temporal correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Hyperlink Prediction Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "The hyperlink prediction problem across the three formulations can be addressed using four distinct algorithmic approaches, each leveraging different mathematical principles and computational techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hyperlink Prediction using Resource Allocation (HPRA)** represents a direct extension of classical link prediction methods to the hypergraph domain [Kumar et al. (2020)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11070). The HPRA algorithm operates on the principle that nodes with higher resource allocation scores are more likely to participate in future hyperedges. The method computes a Hypergraph Resource Allocation (HRA) index that measures the likelihood of hyperedge formation based on the resource allocation principle from network theory. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3.4 (Hypergraph Resource Allocation (HRA) Index):** The Hypergraph Resource Allocation (HRA) index is a similarity measure between two nodes $x$ and $y$ in a hypergraph $G = (V, E)$. It captures both direct and indirect relationships based on shared hyperedges and intermediate neighbors. Let $\\delta(e) = |e|$ denote the size or degree of a hyperedge $e$, $N(v)$ the set of neighbors of node $v$, and $d(z)$ the degree of node $z$. Then:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Direct Resource Allocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{HRA}_{\\text{direct}}(x, y) = \\sum_{e \\in E : x, y \\in e} \\frac{1}{\\delta(e) - 1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This measures how many hyperedges directly connect $x$ and $y$, weighted by the size of those hyperedges.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Indirect Resource Allocation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{HRA}_{\\text{indirect}}(x, y) = \\sum_{z \\in N(x) \\cap N(y)} \\mathrm{HRA}_{\\text{direct}}(x, z) \\cdot \\frac{1}{d(z)} \\cdot \\mathrm{HRA}_{\\text{direct}}(z, y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This accounts for two-hop connections between $x$ and $y$ via intermediate nodes $z$, weighted by the inverse degree of $z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Combined HRA Score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathrm{HRA}(x, y) = \\mathrm{HRA}_{\\text{direct}}(x, y) + \\mathrm{HRA}_{\\text{indirect}}(x, y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This final score combines both direct and indirect resource flows, providing a comprehensive measure for hyperlink prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, for a potential hyperedge $e^* = \\{v_1, v_2, \\ldots, v_k\\}$, HPRA calculates node-hyperedge attachment scores (NHAS) by aggregating resource allocation scores between candidate nodes and existing hyperedge members. The algorithm employs preferential attachment for initial node selection, then iteratively adds nodes based on their NHAS values until the desired hyperedge size is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word Embeddings** approaches adapt traditional node embedding techniques, particularly Node2Vec, to the hypergraph setting for hyperlink prediction [Grover & Lescovec](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2939672.2939754). These methods first transform the hypergraph into a graph representation through techniques such as clique expansion or star expansion, then apply Node2Vec to learn low-dimensional vector representations of nodes. The learned embeddings capture both local neighborhood information and global structural properties of the hypergraph. For hyperlink prediction, the method aggregates node embeddings within potential hyperedges using various combination functions to produce hyperedge-level representations that are used to train classifiers predicting hyperedge formation likelihood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypergraph Neural Networks (HyperGNN)** extend graph neural network architectures to handle hypergraph structures directly, without requiring transformation to ordinary graphs [Feng et al. (2019)](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/4235). The HyperGNN framework employs a two-stage message passing mechanism: first, node features are aggregated to form hyperedge representations, then hyperedge information is propagated back to update node embeddings. Formally, for a hyperedge $e$, the hyperedge embedding is computed as $\\mathbf{h}_e^{(l)} = \\sigma(W_e^{(l)} \\cdot \\text{AGG}(\\{\\mathbf{h}_v^{(l)} : v \\in e\\}))$, and node embeddings are updated as $\\mathbf{h}_v^{(l+1)} = \\sigma(W_v^{(l)} \\cdot \\text{AGG}(\\{\\mathbf{h}_e^{(l)} : e \\in E, v \\in e\\}))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**CHEbyshev Spectral HyperlInk pREdictor (CHESHIRE)** combines spectral graph theory with deep learning techniques for enhanced hyperlink prediction performance [Chen et al. (2023)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38110-7) [Chen & Liu](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.02911). CHESHIRE initializes node embeddings using traditional methods and then refines these embeddings using Chebyshev spectral graph convolution. The method leverages the spectral properties of the hypergraph Laplacian to capture higher-order structural information that may be missed by purely local approaches. The Chebyshev polynomial approximation enables efficient computation of spectral convolutions while maintaining the expressiveness needed for complex hypergraph structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Evaluation Methodologies\n",
    "\n",
    "Each formulation of hyperlink prediction requires specialized evaluation approaches that account for the specific characteristics of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3.5 (Reconstruction Evaluation):** For hypergraph reconstruction, the evaluation framework employs a binary classification approach where each predicted hyperedge is assessed for its existence in the original hypergraph structure. Given a set of predicted hyperedges $\\hat{E} = \\{e_1^*, e_2^*, \\ldots, e_k^*\\}$ and the original hypergraph $\\mathcal{H} = (V, E)$, the evaluation process defines:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y_i = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "1 & \\text{if } e_i^* \\in E \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $y_i$ represents the binary label for the $i$-th predicted hyperedge. Each predicted hyperedge $e_i^*$ is assigned a score $s_i$ based on the internal connectivity measure computed by the prediction algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_i = \\text{Internal_Connectivity}(e_i^*, \\mathcal{H})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The reconstruction quality is then evaluated using the comprehensive seven-metric machine learning framework (discussed below), yielding precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, ROC-AUC, log loss, and Matthews correlation coefficient. Additionally, structural consistency is assessed through separate analysis of hyperedge size distributions, degree distributions, and connectivity patterns between the predicted and original hypergraph structures, providing complementary insights into the reconstruction fidelity beyond the binary classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3.6 (Hidden Hyperedge Evaluation):** The hidden hyperedge prediction evaluation employs a dual binary classification framework that assesses predictions using both exact matching and Jaccard similarity-based criteria. Given a set of predicted hyperedges $\\hat{E} = \\{e_1^*, e_2^*, \\ldots, e_k^*\\}$ and hidden hyperedges $E_{hidden} = \\{e_1^h, e_2^h, \\ldots, e_\\ell^h\\}$, two evaluation schemes are applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exact Matching Evaluation:**\n",
    "$$y_i^{exact} = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "1 & \\text{if } \\exists e_j^h \\in E_{hidden} : e_i^* = e_j^h \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jaccard-based Evaluation:**\n",
    "$$y_i^{Jaccard} = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "1 & \\text{if } \\max_{e_j^h \\in E_{hidden}} J(e_i^*, e_j^h) > \\tau \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $J(e_i^*, e_j^h) = \\frac{|e_i^* \\cap e_j^h|}{|e_i^* \\cup e_j^h|}$ is the Jaccard similarity coefficient and $\\tau = 0.3$ is the similarity threshold. The score for each predicted hyperedge is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s_i = \\max_{e_j^h \\in E_{hidden}} J(e_i^*, e_j^h)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Both evaluation schemes are assessed using the comprehensive seven-metric machine learning framework, with the Jaccard-based evaluation providing more realistic performance assessment by recognizing partial matches between predicted and hidden hyperedges.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition 3.7 (Temporal Prediction Evaluation):** For temporal hypergraph prediction, given a temporal hypergraph with timestamps $t_1, t_2, \\ldots, t_T$, the evaluation framework uses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Training Data:** All hyperedges from timestamps $t_1$ to $t_{T-1}$: $\\mathcal{H}_{train} = \\bigcup_{i=1}^{T-1} E_{t_i}$\n",
    "- **Target Data:** Hyperedges from the final timestamp $t_T$: $\\mathcal{H}_{target} = E_{t_T}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm learns from $\\mathcal{H}_{train}$ and generates a set of predicted hyperedges $\\hat{E}$ that are evaluated against $\\mathcal{H}_{target}$ using the same dual evaluation framework (exact matching and Jaccard similarity) as in hidden hyperedge prediction."
